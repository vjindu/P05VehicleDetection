## Q 1 & 2. Extraction of features from the image dataset
In order for proper classification of images into cars and non cars, features of the give image dataset are extracted. 

Shape features and color features were extracted using the following methods, Histogram of orientation features (HOG), binning color feature and color histogram features.

The code used for extraction of features from each single image is defined in the following functon in 3rd code block of ipython file.

``` python
single_img_features(image, color_space=color_space, 
                            spatial_size=spatial_size, hist_bins=hist_bins, 
                            orient=orient, pix_per_cell=pix_per_cell, 
                            cell_per_block=cell_per_block, 
                            hog_channel=hog_channel, spatial_feat=spatial_feat, 
                            hist_feat=hist_feat, hog_feat=hog_feat)
```

We read in all the images of car and non-car from the dataset provided. An example of car and non car images are displayed below

![alt text][car_noCar]

The HOG features were tested for various color spaces and the result image is displayed below.

![alt text][HOG_car_noCar]


After a lot of trial and error LUV and RGB color spaces seemed to be giving the best results for training using LinearSVM classifier.
LUV seems to be performing a little better than RGB. The spatial size, orient, hog_channel were all tuned to give the best result for the available dataset. The final tuned parameters can be seen below. 

``` python
color_space = 'LUV' # Can be RGB, GRAY, HSV, LUV, HLS, YUV, YCrCb
orient = 8  # HOG orientations
pix_per_cell = 8 # HOG pixels per cell
cell_per_block = 2 # HOG cells per block
hog_channel = "ALL" # Can be 0, 1, 2, or "ALL"
spatial_size = (16, 16) # Spatial binning dimensions
hist_bins = 32    # Number of histogram bins
spatial_feat = True # Spatial features on or off
hist_feat = True # Histogram features on or off
hog_feat = True # HOG features on or off
y_start_stop = [None, None] # Min and max in y to search in slide_window()
``` 

## Q 3. Classifier used for classification and parameters

Spatial histogram and hog features were extracted for classification of images between vehicle and non-vehicle. 

The extracted classification data combining vehicle and non-vehicle was first normalised using ``` StandardScaler() ``` function from scikitlearn (sklearn.preprocessing) function. 20 percent of the data is split into validation data and the remaining 80 percent is used for training the classifier. 

The classifier used was a ``` LinearSVC ``` classifier from sklearn.svm . Hinge loss funtion was used for liear classifier.

The code was implemented in 7th codeblock of the jupyter notebook file.

**Vehicle Detection Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

###Writeup / README


###Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  

I started by reading in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:

![alt text][image1]

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:


![alt text][image2]

#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and...

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using...

###Sliding Window Search

####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

![alt text][image3]

####2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
